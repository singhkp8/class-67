As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle,just like everyone thought.
 The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere.
 He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. 
Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him.
